Bayonet enables online merchants and financial institutions to increase sales and manage risk through collective intelligence.

== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

Bayonet provides an Ecosystem of Trust and Protection where companies can colaborate with each other to combat online fraud together. We provide a secure platform to share and consult data to understand when a consumer is related to fraudulent activity or has a fraud-free record. Different technologies that run algorithms to link parameters seen in different transactions, fed by companies connected to the ecosystem are employed in order to build consumer profiles. By consulting Bayonetâ€™s API, a response with data provided by companies themselves is available in real-time for your risk assesment process to analyze it and take better decisions.
